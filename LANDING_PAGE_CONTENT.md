## Use Cases

### The Busy Working Parent

*Sarah is a working mother with two children in different schools. She sets up weekly subscriptions for both kids - one for Monday-Friday mornings and afternoons, and another for specific days. The app automatically creates all the rides, and she can track both children's commutes simultaneously from her office.*

### The Flexible Family

*The Johnson family needs transportation only three days a week. They create a custom subscription for Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. During school breaks, they simply pause the subscription and resume when school starts again.*

### The Last-Minute Need

*Mark's usual carpool fell through this morning. He quickly opens the Zuanga app, books a one-time ride for his daughter, and within minutes, a driver is on the way. He tracks the entire journey and receives a notification when she arrives safely at school.*

### The Multi-School Family

*The Martinez family has three children attending different schools at different times. They manage all three schedules from one account, each with their own subscription. The app keeps everything organized and sends separate notifications for each child.*
